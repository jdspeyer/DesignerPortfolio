  title: 'Swell',
  missionStatement: 'The main objective of this project was to create a simplistic, user-friendly app to locate a particular item or item. This app idea came out of my love of the ocean, and growing up going to Santa Cruz beaches, I was always in awe of people who surf or do water sports. However, I found quickly through my research that the apps currently exist for surfers to find surf spots, attain correct weather conditions, and find sites that were not frequented as often, could have been more user-friendly, and lacked cohesive user interface principles. My goal was to change this by designing an app that allows users to navigate to a surf or beach spot easily, quickly get all the correct information on one screen, and be guided to their destination.',

Furthermore, I aimed to modernize the cafe’s appearance by crafting a new brand identity. This redesign was created through Adobe XD, and I am proud to mention that it was recognized with a silver student ADDY award at the Inland Empire local competition in 2021.',

  title: 'Gaiani',
  missionStatement: 'My senior capstone project originated from my experience with chronic illness and the absence of functional, sleek, and user-friendly medicine boxes tailored toward the chronic illness community. The traditional medicine boxes used for decades and the current supplement-focused solutions do not adequately cater to the needs of those suffering from chronic illnesses. Through much research and connecting with my main target audient, I have designed a unique solution to cater to the diverse needs of this often-neglected demographic. I have landed on a minimum viable product through this process, from sketching to clay modeling to 3D printing. The product featured two primary parts, “the wreath” and “pods,” inspired by natural forms in nature.',

The poster was designed utilizing the substitution principle, which cleverly incorporates elements of the Dunkin brand while adding a playful touch of modernity. The design thus emphasizes the convenience of on-the-go and delivery services that are so highly sought-after in today’s fast-paced society. The design’s simplicity shines through in efficiently communicating the message.',

  missionStatement: 'Hover is an innovative adaptive utensil designed to modernize the current design of adaptive utensils. Using 3D printing technology and an extensive design process, I created this unique spoon to provide for individuals with arthritis and other disabilities. Adaptive utensils enable this demographic to be independent in eating. However, those on the current market are only tailored for functionality rather than style. Hover bridges this gap by offering a sleek and comfortable design that caters to individuals between 20 and 80. In addition, this utensil gives the hope of being a piece to be shown off rather than an embarrassing implement to be concealed.',

The project’s original goal, as proposed by the professor, was to “construct an image” through physical means. Paying homage to Meta, a company that has become a cornerstone of creativity and inspiration for many, the campaign was designed to celebrate its initiative of bringing creatives together online. The logos of Meta’s parent companies were constructed from foam and hot glue, with over 18 hours in total of cutting and hand construction invested in these pieces.',

  title: 'Sensible App',
  missionStatement: 'Sensible was designed for the semester-long EGR102 course taught at California Baptist University. The course serves as an introduction to fundamental techniques used in engineering design and analysis. Different models of the design process will be examined. A collaborative team-oriented design project will be undertaken. The final project of the course is a robotics competition. The team aims to assemble robots to scan various sensors on a map, indicating the amount of ping pong balls that should be collected. Sensible was developed to replace the outdated reading in the sensors’ data through Google Sheets. Sensible aims to deliver a more reliable, fast, and user-friendly interface for the EGR102 students to read the sensor data during the competition. As a result of the team’s collaboration in this unique format, a scientific paper was published regarding the design thinking methods used to make the application. I was the primary writer of this paper, which can be found on 74 of the linked document.',
